This project was a test to create a fully developed web application that could store all data across multiple companies and provide detailed analytics of teams/companies progress day to day.
Inputs are all manually added to databases as the focus was to report tasks completed on a daily basis, like a daily activity report.
Initially thought of as a means for tracking sales metrics and goals but could also be used, in theory, for recruiting, IT tickets, and more.

Future plans include: 
Incorporating react for better navigation (currently using ajax functions in vanilla javascript to reload section of pages)
Switching to MongoDB instead of SQL mainly for easier custom inputs
More options for graphs and charts of company/team goals and tasks
Incorporating some type of project management features, either like Trello, or an extension of an existing Trello board
